# Whitelist-Dapp

You are launching your NFT collection named `Crypto Devs`. You want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection, so here you are creating a whitelist dapp for `Crypto Devs`

![](https://i.imgur.com/zgY0TGo.png)

## Requirements

- Whitelist access should be given to the first `10` users for free who want to get in.
- There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

Lets start building ðŸš€

---

## Prerequisites

- You can write code in JavaScript (Beginner Track - [Level-0](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Basic-Programming))
- Have set up a Metamask Wallet (Beginner Track - [Level-4](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Crypto-Wallets))
- Your computer has Node.js installed. If not download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Build

### Smart Contract

To build the smart contract we will be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.



 - First, you need to create a Whitelist-Daap folder where the Hardhat project and your Next.js app will later go
 - Open up a terminal and execute these commands
  ```bash
  mkdir Whitelist-Dapp
  cd Whitelist-Dapp
  ```
 - Then, in Whitelist-Daap folder, you will set up Hardhat project 
  ```bash
  mkdir hardhat-tutorial
  cd hardhat-tutorial
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```

- In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat
  ```

  - Select `Create a basic sample project`
  - Press enter for the already specified `Hardhat Project root`
  - Press enter for the question on if you want to add a `.gitignore`
  - Press enter for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers)?`

Now you have a hardhat project ready to go!

If you are not on mac, please do this extra step and install these libraries as well :)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

- Start by creating a new file inside the `contracts` directory called `Whitelist.sol`.

  ```go
  //SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;


  contract Whitelist {

      // Max number of whitelisted addresses allowed
      uint8 public maxWhitelistedAddresses;

      // Create a mapping of whitelistedAddresses
      // if an address is whitelisted, we would set it to true, it is false by default for all other addresses.
      mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;

      // numAddressesWhitelisted would be used to keep track of how many addresses have been whitelisted
      uint8 public numAddressesWhitelisted;

      // Setting the Max number of whitelisted addresses
      // User will put the value at the time of deployment
      constructor(uint8 _maxWhitelistedAddresses) {
          maxWhitelistedAddresses =  _maxWhitelistedAddresses;
      }

      /**
          addAddressToWhitelist - This function adds the address of the sender to the
          whitelist
       */
      function addAddressToWhitelist() public {
          // check if the user has already been whitelisted
          require(!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender], "Sender has already been whitelisted");
          // check if the numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, if not then throw an error.
          require(numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, "More addresses cant be added, limit reached");
          // Add the address which called the function to the whitelistedAddress array
          whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] = true;
          // Increase the number of whitelisted addresses
          numAddressesWhitelisted += 1;
      }

  }
  ```

- Lets deploy the contract to `rinkeby` network.Create a new file named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder

- Now we will write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

  ```js
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

  async function main() {
    /*
    A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
    so whitelistContract here is a factory for instances of our Whitelist contract.
    */
    const whitelistContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Whitelist");

    // here we deploy the contract
    const deployedWhitelistContract = await whitelistContract.deploy(10);
    // 10 is the Maximum number of whitelisted addresses allowed
    
    // Wait for it to finish deploying
    await deployedWhitelistContract.deployed();

    // print the address of the deployed contract
    console.log(
      "Whitelist Contract Address:",
      deployedWhitelistContract.address
    );
  }

  // Call the main function and catch if there is any error
  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```

- Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines, use the instructions in the comments to get your Alchemy API Key URL and RINKEBY Private Key. Make sure that the account from which you get your rinkeby private key is funded with Rinkeby Ether.

  ```

  // Go to https://www.alchemyapi.io, sign up, create
  // a new App in its dashboard and select the network as Rinkeby, and replace "add-the-alchemy-key-url-here" with its key url
  ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL="add-the-alchemy-key-url-here"

  // Replace this private key with your RINKEBY account private key
  // To export your private key from Metamask, open Metamask and
  // go to Account Details > Export Private Key
  // Be aware of NEVER putting real Ether into testing accounts
  RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-rinkeby-private-key-here"

  ```

- Now we will install `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command
  ```bash
  npm install dotenv
  ```
- Now open the hardhat.config.js file, we would add the `rinkeby` network here so that we can deploy our contract to rinkeby. Replace all the lines in the `hardhar.config.js` file with the given below lines

  ```js
  require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
  require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

  const ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL = process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL;

  const RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY;

  module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.4",
    networks: {
      rinkeby: {
        url: ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL,
        accounts: [RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

- Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
  ```
  
- To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
  ```
- Save the Whitelist Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it futher down in the tutorial.

### Website

- To develop the website we will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.
- First, You will need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

  ```
  - Whitelist-Dapp
      - hardhat-tutorial
      - my-app
  ```

- To create this `next-app`, in the terminal point to Whitelist-Dapp folder and type

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

  and press `enter` for all the questions

- Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

  ```
  cd my-app
  npm run dev
  ```

- Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

- Now lets install [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc) and WalletConnect, You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
  Open up a terminal pointing at`my-app` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
  npm install web3modal
  ```

- In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

  ```bash
  npm install ethers
  ```

- In your my-app/public folder, download [this image](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp/blob/main/my-app/public/crypto-devs.svg) and rename it to `crypto-devs.svg`
- Now go to styles folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

  ```css
  .main {
    min-height: 90vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  }

  .footer {
    display: flex;
    padding: 2rem 0;
    border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .image {
    width: 70%;
    height: 50%;
    margin-left: 20%;
  }

  .title {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin: 2rem 0;
  }

  .description {
    line-height: 1;
    margin: 2rem 0;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }

  .button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: blue;
    border: none;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-size: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-bottom: 2%;
  }
  @media (max-width: 1000px) {
    .main {
      width: 100%;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }
  }
  ```

- Open your index.js file under the pages folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments. Make sure you read about React and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html), [React Hooks Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_hooks.asp) if you are not familiar with them.

  ```

- Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`.
- In the constants folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code.
- Replace `"YOUR_WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"` with the address of the whitelist contract that you deployed.
- Replace `"YOUR_ABI"` with the ABI of your Whitelist Contract. To get the ABI for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/Whitelist.sol` folder and from your `Whitelist.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key (it will be. a huge array, close to 100 lines if not more).

  ```js
  export const abi = YOUR_ABI;
  export const WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
  ```

- Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

Your whitelist dapp should now work without errors ðŸš€

### Push to github
